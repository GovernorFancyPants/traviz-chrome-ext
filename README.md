> Find all elements with a specific style on any website

This tool allows you to find all elements on a page with a specific style of your choosing. You decide which CSS property, and the value for that property, to search for.

## How to use

Get the Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/traviz/jbcpaikilmgnepceoigppdimofkkaaaj)

You can use these operators: not equal to ( ! ), greater than ( > ), less than ( < ) and approximately equal to ( ~ ) or none for exact math.

A background color, either random or not, will be assigned to every matching element and a list with metadata and corresponding background color can be found in the container to the left.

Hover the items in the list to display a frame on the corresponding element.

Click an item in the list to scroll the corresponding element into view.

You can fold the menu and still see the colors but have a greater view of the page.
